  <h1>What is Carbon Footprint?</h1>
  <div class="container">
    <p class="para1">
      A carbon footprint is a measure of the total amount of greenhouse gases,
      specifically carbon dioxide (CO2) and other carbon compounds, that are
      emitted directly or indirectly by an individual, organization, event, or
      product throughout its lifecycle. Greenhouse gases trap heat in the
      Earth's atmosphere, contributing to the phenomenon known as global
      warming and climate change. The carbon footprint concept helps quantify
      the impact of human activities on the environment in terms of their
      contribution to the accumulation of greenhouse gases. It is usually
      measured in units of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e), which express
      the total impact of various greenhouse gases in terms of the amount of
      CO2 that would have the equivalent warming effect.

      Carbon footprints can be categorized into two main types: Direct
      Emissions (Scope 1): These emissions are produced directly by an
      individual, organization, or product. Examples include the combustion of
      fossil fuels for heating, transportation, and industrial processes.
      Indirect Emissions (Scopes 2 and 3): Scope 2 Emissions: These are
      indirect emissions associated with the production of the electricity,
      heat, or steam purchased and used by an entity. Scope 3 Emissions: These
      are indirect emissions that occur in the value chain of the entity,
      including activities such as supply chain, transportation, and product
      use. This is often the largest portion of an entity's carbon footprint
      and can be challenging to measure and control.
